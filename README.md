# The Cap Loader simulator for COMPSYS 704

Content of this repository:
* `sys` contains both a SystemJ model and a configuration file of the Cap Loader (`plant.sysj` and `plant.xml`). A template file of the controller and its configuration file are also in this directory (`controller.sysj` and `controller.xml`).
* `src` contains source code of an UI (visualization) written in Java
* `res` contains all the images used in the UI

To build and run the program type `make` followed by `make run`.

Complete `sysj/controller.sysj` and validate functional correctness of your SystemJ controller!
